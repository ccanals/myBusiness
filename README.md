#My Business

##Elevator pitch.

Elevator pitch means the first 30 seconds of an oral presentation, where you have to introduce yourself and introduce the
main topic. This would be my elevator pitch:

Hello, let me introduce myself. My name is Carles Canals, a 19-year-old computer engineering student. I'm here to show
you our project. The main idea is to develop an application that not only reads QR codes using the camera but also these
codes will show the trailer and gameplay of a videogame product in a virtually beautiful way, so that the consumers 
have less problems in choosing their ideal videogame. Of course, the application itself will also contain a survey for
users to answer pretending to select the best game according to their personality.
